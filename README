Beginner's Sprint Exercise

"The Turtle"

This is an exercise with the Turtle object as taught by MrValdez.

The objective is to draw 2 letters --- "FE" --- in 30 minutes.

I have coded it to simulate true hand strokes when writing the letters.

I have done it well within 30 minutes and have also experimented with other
turtle methods (i.e pencolor, goto, circle). Now it looks more like a
logo ;)
